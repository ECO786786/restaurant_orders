# Background

This data comes from [Maven Analytics](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/guided-projects/d7167b45-6317-49c9-b2bb-42e2a9e9c0bc).

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?
2. What were the top 5 orders that spent the most money?
3. View the details of the highest spend order. Which specific items were purchased?

# Tools I Used

- **SQL:** The foundation of my analysis, empowering me to query the database and uncover invaluable insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
